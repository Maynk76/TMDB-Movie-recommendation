# TBDB Movie recommendation system


## Problem Statement

Executive Summary: 
The Movies Recommendation Project aims to develop an advanced system that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences. Leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, these systems are designed to enhance user satisfaction and engagement by suggesting movies that align with their tastes. This report outlines the projectâ€™s objectives, methodologies, data sources, implementation, and outcomes.

Project Objectives:
Develop a robust recommendation algorithm: Create a system uses content-based filtering techniques to provide accurate and relevant movie suggestions.
Enhance user experience: Improve user engagement by offering personalized movie recommendations that cater to individual preferences.
Scalability: Ensure the recommendation system can handle a large volume of data and users efficiently.
Performance Evaluation: Implement metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the recommendation system.




### Methodologies

- STEP 1:
Data Collection:
TMDB Dataset: Utilized the TMDB dataset, which includes millions of movie ratings and metadata such as genres, release year, and user information.
TMDB Credit Data: Integrated additional metadata from The Movie Database (TMDB) to enrich the movie profiles with features such as director, cast, and plot summaries.

- STEP 2:
Data Preprocessing:

Identification of the dataset to be utilized in the model

- STEP 3: Merging the two datasets based on title column. 

- STEP 4:
Out of the given two datasets we need to select appropriate features for our model. Remember our approach is to find the similarity between movies based on the
1)	types of content(genre): people mostly like to watch content of their taste and preference like horror, comedy, adventure and many more.
2)	keyword 
3)	 overview: it gives the overview of the content in movie
4)	 Cast: lead actors and actress in the movie can have a influence on the preference of movies
5)	 Crew: sometime the directors and music artist of the movie can encourage audience to watch the movie
6)	Title.




- STEP 5: Cleaning: Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries to ensure data quality.
- STEP 6:  Feature Engineering: Extracted and transformed features to enhance the recommendation algorithm's performance, including genre vectors, director and cast features and extracting the useful data like the top cast and director in our case.

### Recommendation Algorithm
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering or Content-Based Filtering:  Focused on finding similarities between movies and recommended items that are similar to those a user has liked.

Feature Extraction: Analyzed movie content such as genres, plot summaries, and metadata to create detailed movie profiles.
Environment: Implemented the system using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.


System Architecture: Developed a modular architecture that allows easy integration and scaling. The backend processes data and generates recommendations, while the frontend presents these recommendations to users.
Results
Scalability Tests: Ensured the system's performance remained robust with increasing data size and user base.

## Conclusion
The Movies Recommendation Project successfully developed a sophisticated recommendation system that enhances user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions. The integration of content-based filtering, and vectorization models proved effective in delivering accurate and relevant recommendations. Future work will focus on further refining the algorithms, incorporating real-time data processing, and exploring additional data sources to continuously improve recommendation quality.


## Future Work
Real-time Recommendations: Implementing real-time data processing to update recommendations based on the latest user interactions.
Enhanced Personalization: Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning to adapt recommendations dynamically.
User Privacy: Ensuring robust privacy measures to protect user data while maintaining recommendation accuracy.
